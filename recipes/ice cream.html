    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This sweet butr savory ice cream will have you thinking you are a kid again, waiting patiently for the ice cream truck to roll by! Read on to find out how <strong>YOU</strong> can make this delicious dish!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Heavy Cream</strong> - The basis for all good ice creams is rich heavy cream. </li>
        <li><strong>Whole Milk</strong> - A mix of both heavy cream and whole milk creates the perfect ice cream texture. </li>
        <li><strong>Granulated Sugar</strong> - Any good ice cream will have a good amount of sugar in it, both for sweetness and texture. </li>
        <li><strong>Bubblegum Flavoring</strong> - You'll need between 1 and 2 teaspoons of this flavor ingredient. Read below if you need help finding some.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong> - This, along with the bubblegum flavoring gives this ice cream it's sweet, delicious flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> - A bit of kosher salt helps to balance the sweetness of the ice cream base.</li>
        <li><strong>Coloring</strong> - You can use either pink or red food coloring to get the ice cream to the perfect pink bubblegum color.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprinkles</strong> - I like the small round rainbow sprinkles as shown in the images. They won't bleed color into the ice cream base. Jimmies can be used as well or a mix of the two. Avoid using nonpareils, they will change the color of the ice cream base into a muddy mess.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong>> - This, along with the bubblegum flavoring gives this ice cream it's sweet, delicious flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Gumballs</strong> - Small gumballs are used to garnish individual servings of bubblegum ice cream.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, bubblegum flavoring, vanilla extract, and kosher salt. Whisk for 2-3 minutes until the sugar is dissolved into the mixture. You can test to be sure by rubbing a bit of the mixture between your fingers. When there is no grit, you can be sure that the sugar has dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add pink or red food coloring until you reach your desired shade of pink.</li>
        <li>Churn the ice cream mixture in the bowl of your ice cream machine according to your manufacturer's instructions until it is thick and the consistency of soft-serve ice cream. Mine took about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>When there are two minutes left on the churn, add in the confetti sprinkles, reserving one tablespoon for later.</li>
        <li>Spoon the ice cream into a shallow container or loaf pan. Top with the remaining sprinkles. Press plastic wrap or wax paper to the surface of the ice cream. Freeze for at least 4 hours, or until solid.</li>
        <li>Let sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes before serving, topped with gumballs.</li>
    </ol>
